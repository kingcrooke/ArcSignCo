# Arc Signage Co

Website for Arc Signage Co (legal name: Arc Signage Co LLC), live at https://arcsignco.com.

Static HTML hosted on Netlify (site name `arcsign`). There is no framework and no build step:
Netlify publishes the repository root as-is.

## Files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The single-page site (styles and scripts are inline) |
| `thank-you.html` | Quote form success page, served at `/thank-you` (noindex) |
| `netlify.toml` | Publish settings, security headers, cache headers |
| `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` | Crawl rules and sitemap (update `sitemap.xml` when a page is added) |
| `favicon.ico`, `favicon-32.png`, `icon-192.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` | Browser and home-screen icons |
| `assets/img/` | Optimized, versioned web images (AVIF / WebP / JPEG / PNG) |
| `*.png` in the root | Image masters used to generate `assets/img/` |
| `tools/optimize-images.mjs` | Regenerates `assets/img/` and the icons from the masters |

## How changes ship

`main` is production. Nothing is pushed or merged to `main` without Jesus's approval.

1. **Branch**: create a feature branch from `main` (agents use `cursor/<description>`).
2. **Pull request**: open a PR against `main`. Fill in the PR template checklist.
3. **Deploy Preview**: Netlify builds a preview for the PR and posts its URL on the PR
   (`deploy-preview-<PR number>--arcsign.netlify.app`). Review everything there, on desktop and on a phone.
4. **Jesus approval**: Jesus reviews the preview and approves the PR.
5. **Merge**: after approval, merge to `main`. Netlify deploys production automatically.

Copy that makes a claim (turnaround, location, credentials, clients, reviews) must be verifiable.
If it can't be backed up, soften or remove it.

## Quote form (Netlify Forms)

- The form is `quote-request` in `index.html`. It uses `data-netlify="true"` and a honeypot field
  (`bot-field`). Netlify strips these attributes from the served HTML at deploy time, so they won't
  appear when viewing the live page source; that is expected.
- Every input needs a `name`, and the field must exist in the static HTML, or Netlify drops it.
- Successful submissions redirect to `/thank-you`.
- Submissions, spam, and notification settings live in the Netlify UI
  (Forms, and Project configuration > Notifications). The notification email target is set there, not in code.

## Images and caching

- Files in `assets/img/` are cached by browsers for one year (`immutable`). **Never overwrite a file
  there.** When an image changes, bump `VERSION` in `tools/optimize-images.mjs` (e.g. `v1` to `v2`),
  regenerate, and update the references in the HTML.
- Regenerate images:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p /tmp/img-tools && (cd /tmp/img-tools && npm i sharp)
  NODE_PATH=/tmp/img-tools/node_modules node tools/optimize-images.mjs
  ```

- HTML is always revalidated, so page edits appear as soon as a deploy finishes.

## Analytics

None installed. A placeholder comment in `index.html` marks where a snippet would go. Do not add a
tracking ID until Jesus approves the provider and the ID.

## Environment variables

None are used today. If any are added later, list the variable **names** here (never the values);
values are set in the Netlify UI.
